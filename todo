- how to disable drupal-mode in css-mode if the file is really scss?
- subsequent lines in /** commments aren't auto-indent'ed in JS files. Why?
- get paired delete into smartparens.
- use-package flyspell-correct-ivy isn't actually using ivy,
- https://github.com/Kungsgeten/selected.el or
  https://github.com/fgallina/region-bindings-mode perhaps?
- no syntax check in js/json buffers? because I haven't installed node.js.
- paired delete for multichar pairs?
- paste current region when exiting term-line-mode?
- multi-mode and indentinator (can we make indentinator stop when the mode changes?)
- company and indentinator
  these might help:

would like something like this, but global-hl-line-mode, is, well, global.
(defun my-term-switch-line-char ()
  "Switch `term-in-line-mode' and `term-in-char-mode' in `ansi-term'"
  (interactive)
  (cond
   ((term-in-line-mode)
    (term-char-mode)
    (hl-line-mode -1))
   ((term-in-char-mode)
    (term-line-mode)
    (hl-line-mode 1))))
