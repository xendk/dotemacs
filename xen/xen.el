(defun xen-drupal-mode-beginning-of-line (&optional n)
  "Move point to beginning of property value or to beginning of line.
The prefix argument N is passed directly to `beginning-of-line'.

This command is identical to
`xen-back-to-indentation-or-beginning' if not in a mode derived
from `conf-mode'.

If point is on a (non-continued) property line, move point to the
beginning of the property value or the beginning of line,
whichever is closer.  If point is already at beginning of line,
move point to beginning of property value.  Therefore, repeated
calls will toggle point between beginning of property value and
beginning of line.

Heavily based on `message-beginning-of-line' from Gnus."
